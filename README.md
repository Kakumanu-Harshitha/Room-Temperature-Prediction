# Room-Temperature-Prediction

This Room Air Temperature Dataset is used to analyze and predict room temperature over time. It is specifically valuable for the following purposes:

**Time Series Forecasting**: Predict future room temperatures based on historical data for efficient climate control.

**Trend Analysis**: Identify daily, weekly, or seasonal temperature patterns to understand typical behavior.

**Energy Optimization**: Optimize HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems to save energy and reduce operational costs.

**Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual temperature fluctuations, which could indicate equipment failures or environmental issues.

**Smart Home Automation**: Build predictive models for automating room temperature adjustments in smart homes.

# Features:

Serial no: Sequential numbering for rows.

Datetime1: Hourly representation of the date and time (e.g., 00, 01, etc.).

DAYTON_MW: Recorded room temperature values (in °C or °F).

Datetime: Full datetime corresponding to each temperature measurement.
